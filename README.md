# Create-a-chat-room-using-Socket.io
Websockets are commonly used when streaming data over the internet in real time. Socket.io is a JavaScript library that is built on top of this and is a great, fun tool that can be used to create cool projects such as a chatroom. 

For this  I created a html page that has a simple chat type window on it. Created socket connections and emited the event from the server to the rest of the users
